# Real-time chat

## NodeJS
Inspired from [nodeJS chat](https://socket.io/get-started/chat) on official web-site.

To run it just run `build.sh` then `test.sh`.
If it works just run `run.sh`.

`test.sh` will delete the container upon closing.
`run.sh` will keep it (so you can simulate down events).
